# Print the URL of upstream Tailscale's release notes for one version. shipyard's upstream-notes.sh
# calls this when a release ships a NEW upstream, and links the result from the release notes.
#   usage: upstream-release-notes-url.sh <upstream-version>      (bare: 1.102.3)
#
# Tailscale's GitHub releases only say "see https://tailscale.com/changelog", and that page is
# anchored by DATE (#2026-08-19-client), not by version -- so find the client entry whose title is
# exactly "Tailscale v<version>" and link its anchor. Each entry is
#   <div id="YYYY-MM-DD-client" class="changelog-entry ..."><header ...><h3 class="changelog-title ...">Tailscale v1.102.3</h3>
# Two client releases on one day share one anchor (1.92.1 and 1.92.2 are both #2025-12-10-client);
# the link then lands on that day, which is as close as the page allows.
#
# Some releases have no entry at all (1.102.0), and the page may be unreachable. Either way print
# the client changelog itself and say why on stderr: a less specific link beats none, and notes must
# never fail a release. Runs only when notes are generated, but stays 10.9-safe (BWK awk, no -E).
# TAILSCALE_CHANGELOG_SOURCE overrides where the page is read from (tests use a file:// fixture);
# the printed URL is always the public one.
