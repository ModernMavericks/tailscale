# Write UPSTREAM_VERSION = the pinned tailscale source's OWN VERSION.txt at the pinned REF.
#
# The pin (components/tailscale/version, Renovate-managed) is the single source of truth: bump the
# pin and the upstream version follows automatically, so there is no second file to remember to edit
# and no way for the two to disagree. Same shape as ed25519's derive-upstream-version.sh, which takes
# the pinned commit's date. UPSTREAM_VERSION is therefore build-derived and gitignored, never
# hand-edited; VERSION (the full <upstream>-mavericks.N) derives from it plus the shipped tags.
#
# Reads the file over HTTPS rather than cloning: this runs before anything is fetched, and one raw
# file is cheaper than a clone of tailscale.
